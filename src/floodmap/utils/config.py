"""Minimal YAML configuration loading.

``AGENTS.md`` §14 requires experimental parameters to live in configuration
files rather than source code, and ``architecture.md`` §14 fixes the expected
layout under ``configs/``.

This module intentionally does NOT validate scientific content. The config files
currently hold structural placeholders with unresolved ``TODO`` values, and
coercing them into a strict schema now would mean inventing the very values this
milestone is supposed to leave open. Typed validation belongs in the milestone
that first consumes a given config section.
